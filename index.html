    <h1>The Amazing Anatomical Diagrams of Fritz Kahn, Pioneer of Infographics</h1>
        
    <p>How a German gynecologist transformed science into visual poetry and laid the foundations of modern information graphics.</p>
    
    <p>While the singularity may still be a ways off, mankind has long marveled at analogies between the inner workings of the human body and the industrial processes of the modern world. The most famous of these design-minded biologists, German doctor, illustrator, and author Fritz Kahn, not only revealed startling similarities between the two, he invented the medium of infographics to do so.</p>

<p>Kahn's ability to reframe the functions of the human body as industrial processes is quite uncanny. His drawings explained complex anatomy-like the circulatory, gastric, and cognitive systemsâ€”in terms that anyone can understand. Plus, they were funny. Take a look at three examples below, excerpted from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fritz-English-German-French-Edition/dp/3836548402?tag=gizmodoamzn-20&ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|1496331685[asin|3836548402[authorId|5722017953025243831">new book about Kahn</a> published by Taschen in November.</p>
