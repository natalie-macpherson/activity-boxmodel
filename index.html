        <h1>The Amazing Anatomical Diagrams of Fritz Kahn, Pioneer of Infographics</h1>
        
        <p>How a German gynecologist transformed science into visual poetry and laid the foundations of modern information graphics.</p>
    
        <p>While the singularity may still be a ways off, mankind has long marveled at analogies between the inner workings of the human body and the industrial processes of the modern world. The most famous of these design-minded biologists, German doctor, illustrator, and author Fritz Kahn, not only revealed startling similarities between the two, he invented the medium of infographics to do so.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>His graphic design preferences were eclectic and included such methods as photo-collage, painting and drawing and styles like comic, surrealist, dada and more. The art of analogy was Kahn’s forte (sometimes to the extreme): he might compare an ear with a car or a bird’s feather with railroad tracks, all meant to explain ever more impenetrable phenomena by means which triggered the viewer’s imagination. Kahn employed whatever visual trick he could cobble together for the end result: popular comprehension</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Kahn's ability to reframe the functions of the human body as industrial processes is quite uncanny. His drawings explained complex anatomy-like the circulatory, gastric, and cognitive systems—in terms that anyone can understand. Plus, they were funny. Take a look at three examples below, excerpted from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fritz-English-German-French-Edition/dp/3836548402?tag=gizmodoamzn-20&ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|1496331685[asin|3836548402[authorId|5722017953025243831">new book about Kahn</a> published by Taschen in November.</p>
